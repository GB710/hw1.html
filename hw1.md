        <ul>
            <li>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.</li>
            <br>
            <p>I play football pretty much since I remember myself. Talks on school with friends,
                later on FIFA at home and so on with the friends on the local pitch. <br>I love playing football because when I'm on the pitch, I feel free and carefree.</p>
                <br>
            <li>I've been to Italy when they won World Cup on 2006 and watched a match in England, both experiences were awesome.</li>
            <br>
            <p>An interesting fact that I believe many people don't know is that referees were not used in official soccer matches until 1881. <br>Up until then, people playing were responsible for making any calls.</p>
